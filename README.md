# Simon Game Instructions

## How to Play:

1. **Start the game**: 
   Simon will light up one of the four colored buttons and play a corresponding sound. Your goal is to watch and listen carefully.
   
2. **Repeat the sequence**: 
   After Simon lights up the button, press the same button that lit up. For example, if Simon lights up the red button, press the red button.

3. **Next round**: 
   If you get the sequence correct, Simon will repeat the previous sequence but add one more step (light up a second button after the first). You will need to remember the entire sequence and reproduce it.

4. **Game progression**: 
   As the game continues, Simon will add more steps to the sequence, making it more challenging. Each round requires you to repeat the full sequence with the newly added step.

5. **Losing**: 
   If you press the wrong button or fail to repeat the correct sequence, the game will end.

6. **Scoring**: 
   Some versions of Simon keep track of your longest sequence. The higher the number of steps you correctly repeat, the higher your score.

## Variations (for digital versions or advanced modes):

- **Speed mode**: Sequences must be repeated faster, or the game will time out.
  
- **Multiplayer mode**: Players take turns repeating sequences. If one player makes a mistake, they are eliminated, and the next player takes over the sequence.
